    "### CECL Model Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is designed to estimate the expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset. The key components for this estimation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Default (PD)**: The likelihood that a loan will default.\n",
    "- **Loss Given Default (LGD)**: The proportion of the loan amount that is lost if a default occurs.\n",
    "- **Exposure at Default (EAD)**: The total amount of the loan that is at risk in the event of a default.\n",
    "- **Expected Loss Calculation(EL)** for a loan can be calculated using the formula: $\\text{EL} = \\text{PD} \\times \\text{LGD} \\times \\text{EAD}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a CECL model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output ($y$)**:\n",
    "  - $y = 1$: Indicates that the loan has defaulted.\n",
    "  - $y = 0$: Indicates that the loan has not defaulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Default ($y_{\\text{proba}}$)**:\n",
    "  - $y_{\\text{proba}}$ represents the Probability of Default (PD), which is the predicted probability that a loan will default, as generated by the classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have a CECL model that incorporates these components:"
