    "\n",
    "**Probability of Default (PD)** quantifies the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan within a specified time frame. It is typically estimated using historical data and predictive modeling techniques, such as logistic regression. In this analysis, we generate synthetic loan data and apply logistic regression to predict PD based on borrower characteristics.\n",

    "The code below illustrates the concepts of Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD) within the framework of Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) using a logistic regression model. Additionally, I will provide a simple formula and corresponding code to demonstrate how these concepts can be applied in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Default (PD)**:\n",
    "   - PD represents the likelihood that a loan will default. In the context of a logistic regression model, PD is the predicted probability that the dependent variable (default) equals 1 (i.e., the loan defaults).\n",
    "   - In this analysis, we will use logistic regression to build a CECL model that produces binary outputs: $ y = 1 $ for default and $ y_{\\text{proba}} = \\text{PD} $ for the predicted probability of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Given Default (LGD)**:\n",
    "   - LGD measures the proportion of the exposure that is lost when a default occurs. It is typically calculated as $ 1 - \\text{Recovery Rate} $, where the recovery rate is the percentage of the loan amount that can be recovered after default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exposure at Default (EAD)**:\n",
    "   - EAD represents the total amount of money that is at risk if the loan defaults. It is defined as the outstanding principal balance of the loan at the time of default.\n",

    "The expected loss (EL) for a loan can be calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD) is fundamental to effective credit risk management. Through the use of synthetic data and logistic regression, we have demonstrated how these metrics can be calculated and analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, financial institutions employ sophisticated models and extensive historical data to estimate PD, LGD, and EAD. These calculations are not only essential for regulatory compliance but also for strategic decision-making regarding lending practices, risk pricing, and capital allocation. By accurately assessing these metrics, lenders can better understand their risk exposure, make informed lending decisions, and ultimately enhance their financial stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights gained from this analysis underscore the importance of robust credit risk modeling and the need for continuous monitoring and adjustment of these metrics in response to changing economic conditions and borrower behavior. As the financial landscape evolves, the ability to accurately predict and manage credit risk will remain a critical component of successful lending operations."
